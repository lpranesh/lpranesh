I am an AI enthusiast and I aspire to expand my interest over quantum computing, deep machine learning, and computational modelling of dynamical systems and be an integral part of this age of A.I. I love to apply AI to the field of scientific research by developing new algorithms. I would like to utilize this platform to learn, collaborate with aspiring minds, and grow as a community.
